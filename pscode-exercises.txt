// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Number a plus number b equal to number c

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

An even number is a number that can be divided by exactly 2
You divide the number by 2
Check if there is no remainder
If there is no remainder the number is even
If there is a remainder the number is odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Read numbers a to e and save it for later
Number a plus number b plus number c plus number d plus number e equal number f
Divide number f by 5 and save it in "average" to display it later
Set number a as the largest number "maximum" 

Check if maximum is larger than number b
If maximum is larger keep it as is
If number b is larger set maximum equal to b
Repeat the last three steps for number c d and e

Set number a as the smallest number "minimum" 

Check if minimum is smaller than number b
If minimum is smaller keep it as is
If number b is smaller set minimum equal to b
Repeat the last three steps for number c d and e

Write out "the average of the last five numbers is (average), the smallest is (minimum), the largest (maximum)"
